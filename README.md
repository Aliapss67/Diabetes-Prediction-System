# Diabetes Prediction System

---

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to **predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes** based on various health-related factors and diagnostic measurements. The goal is to provide an early assessment tool that can aid in identifying individuals at risk, thereby supporting timely medical intervention and personalized healthcare strategies.

## Key Features

* **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:** Utilizes `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation of health records.
* **Machine Learning Model:** Implements **Logistic Regression**, a robust classification algorithm, to predict the binary outcome (diabetic or non-diabetic).
* **Predictive Factors:** The model leverages key features such as `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, and `Age`.
* **Model Evaluation:** Employs standard `sklearn.metrics` for comprehensive assessment of model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* **Data Splitting:** Uses `train_test_split` to divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and unbiased evaluation.
* **Cross-Validation:** Incorporates `KFold` and `StratifiedKFold` to ensure the model's reliability and its ability to generalize well to unseen patient data. This robust evaluation helps in minimizing overfitting.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* `numpy` (for numerical operations)
* `pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (for basic data visualization)
* `scikit-learn` (for machine learning functionalities, including `LogisticRegression`, `train_test_split`, `KFold`, `StratifiedKFold`, and `metrics`)

## Project Structure

The project is typically organized within a single Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file, guiding through the following sequential steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Setup:** Importing necessary libraries and loading the diabetes dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial data exploration to understand feature distributions, correlations, and potential issues.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and preparing data for the model.
4.  **Model Training:** Training the Logistic Regression model on the prepared dataset.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using cross-validation and various classification metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
6.  **Prediction:** Demonstrating how to make predictions for new patient data.

## How to Run Locally

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Diabetes-Prediction-System.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Diabetes-Prediction-System.git)
    cd Diabetes-Prediction-System
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repository name if it's different).*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
    *(You might also need `ipykernel` to run the Jupyter Notebook: `pip install ipykernel`)*

3.  **Obtain the dataset:**
    The dataset used for this project (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset or similar) is required. Place your `diabetes.csv` (or whatever your dataset is named) file in the root directory of the cloned repository, or update the file path in the Jupyter Notebook accordingly.

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the project's `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Diabetes_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.
